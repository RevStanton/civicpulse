CivicPulse

A transparent, open-source platform for real-time public sentiment.

CivicPulse is a lightweight civic-tech tool that lets people register their positions on major issues through anonymous, verifiable voting. Every vote generates a public receipt and is stored in an append-only ledger for full transparency.

CivicPulse is not a replacement for elections.
It is a public accountability signal—a way to check the pulse of the people in moments when democratic norms are strained.

Core Principles

Open Source: All code, all logic, and all data structures are publicly visible.

Transparency: Every vote is recorded in a public ledger.

Anonymity: Votes are unlinkable to identities.

Verifiability: Users receive a receipt code they can later check in the ledger.

Nonpartisan: CivicPulse serves democracy itself, not any political agenda.
